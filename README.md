# Solving-AoC-2023
Solving Advent of Code 2023 using Python!

## Introduction
Hello and welcome!

This repository contains my (somwehat cleaned up) **Python code** that I wrote for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I've also written a **solving guide** for each day.

**Be aware that there can be multiple ways to solve the puzzles. I'm only describing that approach I took to solve the puzzle at that moment in time.**

## Code
The code is written in Python and almost all puzzles can be compiled without external librariers (except for day AB and day XY TODO: update this). The input file has to be on the same level as the code file.
## Solving Guide
The solving guide describes the approach I've taken to solve the puzzle and it corresponds to the code.
